  	<h1>About Us</h1>
  	<p>Logicure Global, Inc. was founded in January of 2014 by software engineer Muniba Shaikh and her tech-savvy son Nabeel Shaikh. In the Spring of 2014, Muniba Shaikh began teaching elementary school students at Silicon Valley Academy how to design and build programs with Scratch, a Flash tool by MIT in which developers can create programs by simply snapping blocks together. Since then, Muniba Shaikh has started an after-school computer club, where she teaches a class of 11 students how to create games with Scratch. If you would like to enroll your child in one of Logicure Global, Inc.'s computer programming courses, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:munibashaikh@logicureglobal.com">email us</a>.</p>
